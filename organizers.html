    I’m Rodica. I’m a software developer. I started with Pascal in school and
    recently I’ve been learning Ruby and Rails. I am an avid learner of new
    technologies through both meetups and online self-study resources.
    I’ve been a leader at my previous job through the nature of my duties.
    I organize tasks and I have a clear vision of what needs to be done to finish a project.
    In my spare time I like to dabble with wearables and knitting.
